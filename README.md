Meta-Tic-Tac-Toe
================

Rules for Meta:
===============

There are two players, X and O

Each turn is played on one of the 9 big boards

X starts and plays on the middle board

Based on where each player moves on the small board, that is the board the next player must play on

If a player plays in the top right corner of a small board, then the next player must play somewhere on the top right board

It is not allowed to send a player to a board where they cannot place anything

Each small board is won by the same manner as regular tic-tac-toe, by the first person to get 3 pieces in a row

Once a board is won by either X or O, that board becomes owned by that player, irregardless of any future piece placement on the board

A play wins when they someone has three small boards that belongs to them connected in the same manner as regular tic-tac-toe

Playing the Game:
=================

Upon starting the game, you will be presented with the big board on the right and 9 buttons on the left

Each player will use the 9 buttons to set where in the current board they would like to place

The current board is highlighted in yellow and the previous board in grey.
